# Book Catalog API

C# API for books, along with the genres and authors of the books. The API uses Entity
Framework to deal with persistance of data, FluentValidation to validate dtos and Swagger
for documentation.

Along with minimum every API needs, this API shows how to deal with N to N relationships 
when using EF, how to implement validations with FluetValidation, how to implement 
authentication with a global API key, and how to implement filtering using query parameters.
